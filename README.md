### Hi, I'm Vasilii ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack web & app developer student and on my way to graduate from BloomTech within the next couple of months. I have a medical background and a passion for coding. I decided to change my career and become a full stack web developer, because I believe the future will be more focused on tele/cyber medicine. 

Bilingual in Russian and English. I value attention to detail, integrity, and commitment. I am hard working, eager to learn, honest, and reliable. I have organizational ability in high stress situations and ability to coordinate multiple tasks. I work well independently and in group settings.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Coder Heroes, a nonprofit organization that aims to empower youth through coding courses.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on computer science projects related to the medical field.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: GitHub, LinkedIn, E-mail.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to cook, you can say I am a Full **SNACK** Developer.
