### Hi, I'm Vasiliy.

I'm a full stack web & app developer student and on my way to graduate from BloomTech within the next couple of months. I have a medical background and a passion for coding. I decided to change my career and become a full stack web developer, because I believe the future will be more focused on tele/cyber medicine. 

Bilingual in Russian and English. I value attention to detail, integrity and commitment. I am hard working, eager to learn, honest, and reliable. I have organizational ability in high stress situations and ability to coordinate multiple tasks. I work well independently and in group settings. ðŸ‘‹
